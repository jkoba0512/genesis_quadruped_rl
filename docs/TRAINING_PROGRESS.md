# Training Progress Tracker

## Current Training Status (Live)

### üèÉ Active Training Session
- **Method**: GPU-isolated chunk training (50 episodes per chunk)
- **Status**: Chunk 5 in progress (Episodes 200-250)
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti (8GB VRAM)
- **Memory Usage**: ~666MB GPU, stable across chunks

### üìä Completed Training Chunks

| Chunk | Episodes | Status | Model Checkpoint | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|------------------|-------|
| 1 | 0-50 | ‚úÖ Complete | `chunk_000050.zip` | Initial learning phase |
| 2 | 50-100 | ‚úÖ Complete | `chunk_000100.zip` | Basic balance emerging |
| 3 | 100-150 | ‚úÖ Complete | `chunk_000150.zip` | First walking attempts |
| 4 | 150-200 | ‚úÖ Complete | `chunk_000200.zip` | Improved stability |
| 5 | 200-250 | üèÉ Running | In progress | Current chunk |

### üé• Video Progress Documentation

**Recorded Learning Chunks:**
1. **Chunk 1: Early Learning** (`chunk1_early_learning.mp4`)
   - Random movements, discovering joint limits
   - Learning basic balance concepts
   
2. **Chunk 2: First Steps** (`chunk2_first_steps.mp4`)
   - Coordinated leg movements emerge
   - Basic forward motion attempts
   
3. **Chunk 3: Current Progress** (`chunk3_current_progress.mp4`)
   - More stable walking pattern
   - Better ground contact awareness

**Combined Videos:**
- `go2_three_chunks_progression.mp4` - Side-by-side comparison of all chunks

## Training Architecture

### Memory-Safe GPU Training
The training uses a novel chunk-based approach to prevent Genesis memory accumulation:

```bash
# Automated script manages the entire process
./run_5k_with_isolation.sh

# Each chunk runs as isolated process:
# 1. Load latest model
# 2. Train 50 episodes
# 3. Save checkpoint
# 4. Exit and cleanup GPU
# 5. Auto-start next chunk
```

### Key Features
- **Automatic Resume**: Continues from interruptions
- **GPU Memory Protection**: Full cleanup between chunks
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed logs and checkpoints
- **Video Generation**: Visual progress at milestones

## Performance Metrics

### Training Speed
- **Episodes/Hour**: ~100-150 (varies by chunk)
- **Steps/Episode**: 400
- **Total Steps/Hour**: 40,000-60,000

### Reward Evolution
| Chunk | Avg Reward | Max Reward | Improvement |
|-------|------------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | 15.2 | 45.3 | Baseline |
| 2 | 28.7 | 52.1 | +89% |
| 3 | 35.4 | 58.9 | +133% |
| 4 | 42.1 | 63.2 | +177% |
| 5 | TBD | TBD | In Progress |

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Session)
1. Complete Chunk 5 (Episodes 200-250)
2. Continue with Chunks 6-10 (Episodes 250-500)
3. Generate Chunk 4 video when training pauses

### Short Term (Next 24 Hours)
1. Reach 1,000 episodes milestone
2. Create comprehensive progress video
3. Evaluate walking quality improvements

### Long Term (This Week)
1. Complete 5,000 episode target
2. Compare with 12-hour training results
3. Fine-tune based on performance

## Training Commands

### Continue Training
```bash
# Check current progress
ls -la training_5k_restarts/models/

# Continue from latest checkpoint
./run_5k_with_isolation.sh

# Or manually run next chunk
python train_with_restarts.py --start_episode 250 --num_episodes 50
```

### Monitor Progress
```bash
# Real-time training output
tail -f training_5k_restarts/logs/monitor.csv

# GPU usage
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi

# TensorBoard
tensorboard --logdir training_5k_restarts/logs
```

### Generate Videos
```bash
# Evaluate specific checkpoint
uv run python scripts/evaluate_sb3.py training_5k_restarts/models/chunk_000250.zip --render --episodes 1

# Create progression video
uv run python generate_learning_progression_video.py
```

## Known Issues & Solutions

### GPU Memory Warnings
- **Issue**: "GPU memory access not isolated"
- **Status**: Warning only, doesn't affect training
- **Solution**: Using process isolation between chunks

### Robot State Properties
- **Issue**: Deprecation warnings for state properties
- **Status**: Non-critical, will be addressed in future update
- **Workaround**: Training continues normally

### Process Exit Code 139
- **Issue**: Occasional segmentation fault between chunks
- **Status**: Handled by automatic restart mechanism
- **Impact**: Minimal, training resumes from checkpoint
